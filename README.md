# Lab: Make an app with the Countries API

Your task is to build an app that uses this API endpoint [https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all) to display information on the countries of the world :earth_africa:

## MVP

Your app should be able to:
- Allow the user to select a single country and display information about it (at least the country's name and flag).
- Allow users to add their favourite countries to a list that is also displayed in your app.

## Extension

- Show the total population of the world:

  - Use a method to calculate this from the countries data
  - Have this method update a property in the state (`data` object)
  - Show this property in the app
  
## Super-duper Extensions
  
- Show a list of the selected country's neighbouring countries.
- Prevent the same country being added to the user's favourite countries list twice.
